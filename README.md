# web-scraping

* Get started
If you don't already have it installed, install virtualenv so that your Python programs can run in their own virtual environments free
of dependency confusion.
`pip install virtualenv`

* Next we can run code using our virtualenv after setting up our shell
`source *_PATH_TO_VENV_*/bin/activate`

* Once our environment is ready we can install our requirements
`pip install -r *_PATH_TO_PROJECT_*/requirements.txt`

* Now we need to set up where we would like our images to save
`python setup.py`

* Finally we can run our scraper.
`python run.py`
