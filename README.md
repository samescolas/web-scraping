### First if you don't already have it installed, install virtualenv so that your Python programs can run in their own virtual environments free of dependency confusion.
```pip install virtualenv```

### Next we can run code using our virtualenv after setting up our shell
```source venv/bin/activate```

### Once our environment is ready we can install our requirements
```pip install -r requirements.txt```

### Now we need to set up where we would like our images to save
```python setup.py```

### Finally we can run our scraper.
```python run.py```
