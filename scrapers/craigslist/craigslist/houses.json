I'm looking to extend my stay in France if I can find a subletter to fill the room -- Orginally I was only going to be gone 2 weeks and didnt think subletting was worth it, but now that I can stay longer, it'd be a good deal for someone -- if you need a whole month, the dates can be flexible as I haven't booked my return leg yet.\n\nMy roommate can show you the place if you'd like and I left it ready for someone in case this happened --there's bedding, shelving and underbed storage for you -- I put all my stuff in the closest so you just wouldn't have access to that.\n\nMore info:\n\nThe private room and whole apartment are huge, getting tons of natural light from the loft windows overlooking Bedford ave in the best location in Williamsburg at N 5th st, 2 blocks from the L train to Manhattan. The room is extremely spacious with an exposed brick lounge corner and desk if you need to get anything done.\n\nThe living room has a great record collection and projector for any movie nights you may want to have, streaming from Roku and AppleTV. The kitchen has a big island bar if you're into cooking and roof access has sweet views of Manhattan. The loft is on the third of five floors of a converted brassiere factory building.\n\nThe location is right in the middle of Williamsburg with tons of cafes, shops, restaurants, groceries, bars, music/movie venues, etc. just outside, even an independent bookstore that Amazon hasn't made extinct right below your room.\n\nThe Apartment is a 3 bedroom, 1 bathroom. My roommates, Simone and Jason, shower early and are usually out the door to their full-time jobs by 8:30am. They're both super friendly and we've all lived together for over 2 years now.\n\nOther stuff I can think of:\n\nSimone sometimes hosts a potluck dinner at the apt so you might have to eat some delicious food if you're around. (a tough ask I know)\n\nThere's a drop off laundry on the block or a normal laundromat a block and a half away.\n\nGroceries like Foodtown, Whole Foods and Duane Reade are all 1 block away.\n\nWe're plant-friendly as you can tell from the photos!\n\nHaving guests is cool, but hoping you don't throw any giant ragers.\n\nJust respond with your info any questions - and I can arrange for Simone to connect with you\n\nBrian**    ", "title": "$700 -Giant Room Over Bedford Ave in Sunny Loft--sublet thru May 16ish", "price": null, "bedrooms": null, "dogs": true, "post_dt": "Apr 19", "cats": true, "link": "https://newyork.craigslist.org/mnh/roo/d/700-giant-room-over-bedford/6565276022.html", "factoids": "furnished,apartment,private bath,private room", "imgs": "", "smoking": null, "sqft": null},

Minimal noise and lots of natural light. Two closets in the room.\n\nYou'd be living with 3 roommates, 3 full bathrooms, and a backyard space with a garden. The ground floor is all shared space: a kitchen, living room, and dining room. The top two floors are the bedrooms. This place has really an odd amount of space for a New York apartment. The place is great for hosting people since the first floor is shared and has tons of room. It also has a great location: across the street from a grocery store and 24 hour pharmacy. A block from the subway. \n\nAs for me, I'm a 37 year old freelance media producer. I host the occasional dinner party or Groupmuse concert. I'm big on sharing, so if you have plants you want to put in common spaces or have other ideas for making the place nice, that's good too. We don't need to be good friends, but ideally you are someone who enjoys people and chatting in the kitchen. \n\nWe're looking for someone for May 1.

We're looking for a new fourth roommate to join us in our new apartment as our original roommate will be heading back home. \n\nWe're in our late 20s. We've had a pretty relaxed and spacious place/environment with constant good vibes we'd like to keep into the new place. We all work in the entertainment industry. There's a cat here, he's a little too social, but pretty chill and sleeps more then we do. Very 420. Open-minded and open to all. We all work full-time, so constantly in and out of the house, business-traveling across country etc.. We like to have people over especially during football season (Watching games, Madden, You don't have to like football to hang out) dinner, watch movies/wine and those sort of things (We have a sweet home theatre set-up). We want it to be a place to come home to and decompress/relax and you're always welcome to have guests over. \n\nAbout you: Open to all. We've had multiple sublets that we're still friends with that have been male, female, international, artists. It's a great environment for anyone new to the city or international or just anyone needing a temporary longer place while they transition or visiting for a year etc. Again there is a cat that lives here, so must be okay with cats. We're 420 and smoke around the house. \n\nWe have a few prospective places we're solidifying on which are in Bushwick/Flatbush on The J/L Line and in Sunset Park/Bay Ridge area closer to Prospect Park on the N/R/W Line. These are the areas we'd like to stay in. The new place would be just as spacious as the one we have now with two bathrooms, duplex-style. You'd be subleasing and looking for at least a 6 month sublet to a year sublet with a move in date of June 1st. Rent will be anywhere from $600-$700 max plus Electric, Gas, Internet utilities. \n\nWe have extra bedroom furniture: Bed, Desks, etc. You'd definitely be able to use if needing a furnished room. \n\nEmail us about yourself (Career/What do you like to use your free time doing?), Let us know you're ready to move in June 1st, income/job and links to social media (make sure you're not a robot) and we'll reach out to  see about visiting our current place and meeting everyone to see if it'd be a good fit and schedule a showing of the new place/help input on deciding on new apartment if we haven't selected yet. First month's rent & security deposit before move in. $1200-$1400 total. We'll start scheduling to meet people beginning of May. \n\nThanks!\n    ", "title": "Fourth Roommate to join sublease apartment - June 1st - Can Furnish", "price": "$675", "bedrooms": null, "dogs": null, "post_dt": "Apr 19", "cats": null, "link": "https://newyork.craigslist.org/brk/roo/d/fourth-roommate-to-join/6565280893.html", "factoids": "furnished,apartment,no private bath,private room", "imgs": "", "smoking": null, "sqft": null},
